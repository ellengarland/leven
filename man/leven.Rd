\title{Slow Levenshtein calculation}
\usage{
leven(x, y, cost_matrix = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The first vector}

\item{y}{The second vector}

\item{cost_matrix}{An optional cost matrix to specify the cost of specific substitutions.}
}
\value{
The distance between x and y
}
\description{
This function is designed to compute the Levenshtein distance in a way which is simple to understand and runs in R without any native support
}
